        <h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>
        <br>
        <h5>"I'm afraid, Dave..."
        <br>-HAL the computer in 2001: A Space Odyssey.
        <br>
        <br>There's reason to be afraid. There's very good reason indeed, if you're someone who likes their music unchallenging, simple, and easy to define and digest.
        <br>But if you want something dark, mysterious, savage, and unsettling, something that will force you to confront the unknown and possibly alter the way you look at the world, then prepare yourself for Mudvayne.
        </h5>
        <p>
        <br>Formed in Peoria, Illinois, in 1996, its members adopting the unusual pseudonyms Kud (C. Gray) (vocals), Gurrg (G. Tribbett) (guitar), and sPaG (M. McDonough) (drums). The group's original bassist was replaced after two years by Ryknow (R. Martinie).
        <br>
        <br>During their development, the band members began the practice of applying bizarre makeup.
        <br>
        <br>It's no coincidence that the opening track on Mudvayne's stunningly heavy debut album, L.D. 50, is titled "Monolith," after the brooding alien artifact at the heart of Stanley Kubrick's classic 2001: A Space Odyssey.
        <br>
        <br>"The overall theme of the album reflects and embodies ideas about the evolution of consciousness, transformation, and the risks involved in experimenting with things that can change a person's point of view, internally and externally," says drummer sPaG. "And the monolith in Kubrick's film was also a representation of that."
        <br>
        <br>Like that cryptic black object, Mudvayne keep their secrets well-even their faces are hidden in hal-lucinatory colors and symbols-but make no bones about their desire to fuck with your head. Taking the intensity of the new school of heavy rock one step further, Mudvayne has left a long trail of shattered preconceptions and blown minds in their wake. Next victims: the world at large.
